# Text Color Script

## Description
The following script defines text and background color variables using ANSI escape codes for different colors and styles. It then uses the echo command to display text in different colors, styles, and combinations of text and background colors.

The script first defines three types of color variables: text color, bold text color, and underlined text color. For each type, it defines eight different colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, purple, cyan, and white. It also defines eight background color variables for each of the same colors. Finally, it defines a reset variable to return the color to the default.

After defining the color variables, the script demonstrates the different colors and styles by using the echo command to display text in each of them. The text is displayed in the corresponding color or combination of colors, and the reset variable is used to reset the color to the default after each display.

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
2. Run the command
```bash color.sh```

The script can be used to colorize other scripts by adding `.color.sh` to the beginning of the script file name.
